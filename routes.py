        "savings": "ðŸ’¡ A good rule is the 50/30/20 budget: 50% needs, 30% wants, 20% savings. Start automating savings every month.",
        "budget": "ðŸ’¡ Track your expenses using categories (rent, food, transport). Always aim to save 20-30% of income.",
        "loan": "ðŸ’¡ Always pay high-interest loans first, like credit cards. Consider consolidating if you have multiple EMIs.",
        "investment": "ðŸ’¡ Diversify! Mutual funds, index funds, and SIPs are safe starting points. Avoid putting all money in one asset.",
        "emergency fund": "ðŸ’¡ Keep at least 3â€“6 months of expenses in a liquid fund or savings account for emergencies.",
        "retirement": "ðŸ’¡ Start early! Even small SIPs in mutual funds or NPS compound greatly over decades.",
        "credit score": "ðŸ’¡ Pay your EMIs/credit card bills on time, keep utilization under 30%, and avoid too many loan applications.",
        "insurance": "ðŸ’¡ Health insurance and term life insurance are must-haves. They protect your family and finances.",
        "expenses": "ðŸ’¡ Track small daily spends â€” they add up. Cut unnecessary subscriptions and reduce eating out."
